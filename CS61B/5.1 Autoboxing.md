we cannot provide a primitive type as an actual type argument for generics, e.g. `ArrayDeque<int>` is a syntax error. Instead, we use `ArrayDeque<Integer>`. For each primitive type, we use the corresponding reference type as shown in the table below. These reference types are called "wrapper classes".
