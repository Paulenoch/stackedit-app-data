 **B-trees** or **2-3-4/2-3 Trees**. 2-3-4 and 2-3 refer to the number of children each node can have. 

An 2-3-4 tree can have 2, 3, or 4 children while a 2-3 tree can have 2 or 3. This means that 2-3-4 trees split nodes when they have 3 nodes and one more needs to be added. 2-3 trees split after they have 2 nodes and one more needs to be added.

无论用何种顺序构建B-Tree，最后的结构都会 **bushy.**

-   All leaves must be the same distance from the source.
    
-   A non-leaf node with k items must have exactly k+1k+1 children.
